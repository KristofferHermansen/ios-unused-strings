# iOS Unused Keys
📝 A script that finds unused localized strings generated by SwiftGen.

## How it works
1. It finds all string keys in `.strings` files
2. Converts the keys into Localize generated format: `"homeScreen.FULL.15.main_title.` => `HomeScreen.Full._15.mainTitle`
3. Searches through the source code and finds which keys are not used

## Usage
1. Open the project and build
2. Find `UnusedKeys` executable file in Products folder in the Project Navigator in XCode
3. Drag and drop to your terminal
4. Pass a directory which contains your `.strings` file as the first command line argument
5. Pass directories where you want to search in.
6. Press enter. Magic 🪄

Example: `/Users/username/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/UnusedKeys-abc/Build/Products/Debug/UnusedKeys /Users/username/Projects/AwesomeProject/Resources /Users/username/Projects/AwesomeProject/`
