# iOS Unused Keys
📝 A script that finds unused localized strings generated by SwiftGen.

## How it works
1. It finds all string keys in `.strings` files
2. Converts the keys into Localize generated format: `"generic_password.` => `L10n.Generic.password`
3. Searches through the source code and finds which keys are not used

## Usage
1. Open the project
2. Add signing in project settings
3. Edit Scheme and add 2 arguments
    1. Path to Resources folder containing the Localizable.strings file, fx: `/Users/{user}/Git/{project}/{target}/Resources`
    2. Path to the folder the program should look for string uses fx: `/Users/{user}/Git/{project}`
4. Run the program and wait for the the complete list of unused strings to be printed

## Disclaimer 🚧
**This script is not guaranteed to process perfectly.**

**This script does not currently support the stringsdict file for plurals**
